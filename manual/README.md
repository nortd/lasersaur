Lasersaur Manual
================

This is the gh-pages branch which is mapped to [www.lasersaur.cc/manual](http://www.lasersaur.cc/manual) .

For the most part the Lasersaur manual can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/nortd/lasersaur/wiki). The html part of the lasersaur manual is here (build, bom) but the markdown files are only forwarding to the corresponding wiki pages.
