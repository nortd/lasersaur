Lasersaur Manual
===============

This manual is the main resource for both **building and maintaining** a Lasersaur laser cutter. The basic idea is, when you build it you can easily maintain it. The other idea is that an open source design can improve over time through the collaboration of many people. We hope in three years it will have evolved to the point where it has multiple robotic arms sticking out capable of building space stations :)
